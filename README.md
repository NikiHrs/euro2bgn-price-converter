# Price Scanner (EUR â†’ BGN OCR)

A web application for scanning prices from images using the Google Cloud Vision API. It detects numeric values (e.g., prices) and converts them from **EUR to BGN** using a fixed conversion rate (**1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN**).

The app is optimized for mobile and supports camera input and multi-image uploads. Images are annotated with OCR results and presented with the extracted numbers and their BGN equivalents.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/price-scanner.git
cd price-scanner
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

## Google Cloud Vision Integration

- Images are uploaded via the frontend and stored temporarily
- The backend sends the image content to the Cloud Vision API
- Text detection is performed using `image_annotator_client.document_text_detection()`
- Detected numbers are extracted using regex and converted to BGN
- The results are annotated on the image and returned as base64-encoded strings

---

## Deployment

This app can be deployed using any Python-compatible hosting environment that supports:

- Google Cloud credentials
- External HTTP requests to the Cloud Vision API

Options include:

- Google Cloud Run
- Render

Make sure to set the environment variable for credentials securely.
